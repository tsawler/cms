# cms

An embeddable content management system for Go web applications. Import it
as a module, hand it a Postgres pool, and mount its handlers — no external
files, no separate install. See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the full
architecture and build plan.

**Status: phase 1 (foundation).** Auth, sessions, migrations, and the admin
shell with user management are working. Page rendering, media, in-place
editing, snippets, blog/news, and FR/EN localization are next.

## Quick start

```go
c, err := cms.New(cms.Config{DB: pool}) // pool is a *pgxpool.Pool
if err != nil { ... }
if err := c.Migrate(ctx); err != nil { ... }          // embedded migrations
if _, err := c.SeedAdmin(ctx, "you@example.com", "You", "a strong password"); err != nil { ... }

mux.Handle("/admin/", http.StripPrefix("/admin", c.Admin()))
mux.Handle("/", c.Pages())
```

## Running the example

```sh
cd examples/basic
docker compose up -d      # Postgres on localhost:5433
go run .
```

Then open <http://localhost:4000/admin/> and log in with
`admin@example.com` / `password123` (development defaults; override with
`CMS_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `CMS_ADMIN_PASSWORD`).

## Notes for host applications

- All tables are prefixed `cms_`, so the CMS can share a database with the
  host app.
- `Migrate` is safe to run on every startup and from multiple instances
  concurrently.
- Set `Config.SecureCookies = true` in production (HTTPS).
- `Config.AdminPath` must match wherever you mount `Admin()`; it defaults
  to `/admin`.
